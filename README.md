# M2R - James Stein Estimator

M2R Group Project - Imperial College London

# Abstract:

This paper analyses what the James-Stein Estimator is, why we introduce the
James-Stein Estimator, and why it is a better method to estimate the true mean
vector of a multivariate normal random variable under the assumption that it
follows $N(θ, I_p)$ with dimension $p ≥ 3$ as compared to the naive estimator. To
answer these questions, this paper analyses the performance of the James-Stein
Estimator by considering its dominance over the naive estimator and comparing
it with naive estimator through analysing the distribution of their loss functions.
The limitation and potential improvements of the James-Stein Estimator are
also discussed in this paper. To further evaluate the performance of the James-Stein Estimator, comparison between the loss function over absolute error norm
and Euclidean norm is discussed as well. As for real-life implications, a football
example which estimates the goal to shot ratios of football players is introduced
to demonstrate the better performance of the James-Stein Estimator.
